bluemoon_scene,SHIP,"The Scene has a curious origin, a trader once tried to retrofit kite in order to more efficiently broadcast advertisements, the enginner in charge of the project managed to directly connect the ship core energy supply to the display screen, overheating the fuel reserves in a Blue Moon Hangar a few kilometers away, thus the blueprints where seized by the Knights Order.

bluemoon_genet,SHIP,"The Rider is a custom-made design specially designed to reduce the depency on foreign designs by the Bluemoon, with specific decisions taken by the Grandmaster of the Order, in clear disregard for his advisors, nominally it covers the lack of sustained firepower in the ranks of the Armada, the personal opinion of the captains in charge of them may differ.
It is said that Genets are made in the form of an ancient symbol, most people think that that’s just Ocp lying to hide the wonkiness of the design.

""I think i saw enough cat urine for a lifetime, but creating a material based on the chemical composition of catnip was an interesting endeavour."" - Ocp, Lead Bluemoon Engineer",,,
